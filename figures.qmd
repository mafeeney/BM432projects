### Figure Preparation

Figure preparation checklist:  
Determine what point you wish to convey with your figure and the most effective way of conveying that point (visualization)
Remove any extraneous or distracting data that distracts from the main message of your figure
Determine how large the figure needs to be: how much space will it take up on a page? Will it be easy for your reader to see key details if the figure is this size?
Check that the figure is clear and not pixellated: will your reader be able to see all the important details? Is the resolution good enough?
Check that the colour scheme you have chosen is colour-blind friendly and not visually jarring
Check that any fonts used are legible at the size printed
Figure titles should give a concise "take-home message" conveying the result(s) shown in the figure
Figure legends should give enough detail about the experiment for the reader to understand what was done (the figure should be able to stand on its own)
