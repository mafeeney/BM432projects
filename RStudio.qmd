## General R Studio Resources/Getting Started

Depending on your project, you may find the following resources useful - please note that this is by no means an exhaustive list, just a starting point - there are many other helpful resources out there. While you do not necessarily need to use R/R Studio for your data analysis, you will likely find that being able to work in R is an important transferable skill and important for your future career. Feel free to discuss with Dr. Feeney if you have any questions.
