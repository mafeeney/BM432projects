### Writing

Please go through the [Thesis submission checklist](./Thesis_submission_checklist.docx)

Slides for our [Writing tutorial](./Writing_Tutorial.pptx)

Writing checklist: 
1. Identify key results (outline/bullet points)
2. Start writing by first making your figures (the "backbone" of your story)
3. Write the methods section (should cover every experiment presented in your figures/tables)
4. Write your results section, going through each of your results (figures). 
4b. For each experiment, explain: 1. what you were trying to do (aim),  2. how you did it (method),  3. what you found (results), 4. what it means (significance)
5. Write your discussion (what do your results mean)
5b. Can you create a model figure illustrating your results and placing them in the context of what was previously known?
 5c. Make sure that any information essential for understanding your results (context) was present in the introduction. In your discussion, have you gone back to address all the key points raised in your intro?
 6. Proofread, edit, and improve your draft
 7. Write an abstract and decide on a title
