# General Thesis Writing Guidance

Please go through the [Thesis submission checklist](./Thesis_submission_checklist.docx) and ensure that your thesis meets all the guidelines before submitting it.

Slides for our [Writing tutorial](./Writing_Tutorial.pptx)

## Writing checklist:

1.  Identify key results (outline/bullet points)

2.  Start writing by first making your figures (the "backbone" of your story)

3.  Write the methods section (make sure you cover every experiment presented in your figures/tables)

4.  Write your results section, going through each of your results (figures) in a logical order.

    ## Organize your thoughts logically. 

    For each experiment, explain:

    1.  your aim (the reason why you did the experiment)

    2.  the method (how you did the experiment)

    3.   the results (what you found)

    4.  the significance (what the results mean)

    always in that order
    :::

5.  Write your discussion (what do your results mean?)

    ## Writing a Good Discussion Section 

    Can you create a model figure illustrating your results and placing them in the context of what was previously known?

    Make sure that any information essential for understanding your results (context) was present in the introduction. In your discussion, have you gone back to address all the key points raised in your intro?

    Make sure you do not just reiterate/rehash the points raised in your results section. Instead, make sure you put your results in the broader context (what is known in the literature? How do your results relate to other systems/types of cells/situations/etc.?)

6.  Proofread, edit, and improve your draft based on feedback.

7.  Write an abstract and decide on a title
