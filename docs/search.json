Will it be easy for your reader to see key details if the figure is this size? Check that the figure is clear and not pixellated: will your reader be able to see all the important details? Is the resolution good enough? Check that the colour scheme you have chosen is colour-blind friendly and not visually jarring Check that any fonts used are legible at the size printed Figure titles should give a concise “take-home message” conveying the result(s) shown in the figure Figure legends should give enough detail about the experiment for the reader to understand what was done (the figure should be able to stand on its own)\nWhy You Must Plot Your Growth Data On Semi-log Graph Paper"

Make sure that any information essential for understanding your results (context) was present in the introduction. In your discussion, have you gone back to address all the key points raised in your intro? 6. Proofread, edit, and improve your draft 7.
