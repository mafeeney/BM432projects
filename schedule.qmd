This [project schedule](/assets/ProjectSchedule.docx) is intended as a guide to help you manage your time during your final year honours project. You should feel free to modify it as needed to best support your learning needs (for example, by adding additional key dates such as personal project milestones or modifying the suggested activities to better fit your schedule and needs).

You are expected to attend all meetings/group meetings. You should have completed any indicated activities for that meeting (listed in “What you should do to prepare”). You should also come prepared with any questions (e.g., about papers you have read, results from your experimental work, general questions about good scientific practices, etc.)

Note that the resources provided (e.g., papers listed in the project descriptor, resources linked for each week) are only intended as a <u>starting point</u>. You are expected to search the literature independently (this is part of your project performance mark.) You are also strongly encouraged to seek out additional resources to support your learning and development as a researcher (e.g. time management apps/resources, ggplot2 tutorials, additional writing tips/guidance….)

You should make certain that you understand the points listed in the “Comprehension check” for each week and you should read the indicated resources/search the literature/check with Dr. Feeney for further guidance if you are not sure about any point.

Please be sure to check the BM432 MyPlace page regularly for any updates to official deadlines.
